# Pig-game
This project is done to get better what I've learnt JS and DOM so far. And It's highy recommended by my mentor to to it independantly. Thanks

Extra infor about the game: Pig is a simple dice game first described in print by John Scarne in 1945. Players take turns to roll a single dice as many times as they wish, adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1.
